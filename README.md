# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

## Purpose:
### The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. Companies like FitBit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Data Source:
### Detail information can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

## Data File Locaton:
### Source from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## Procedure:
### 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Output:
### CodeBook.md : Reference of variables 
### README.md : Information of run_analysis.R
### run_analysis.R : R script of this analyzeR
### Tidy.txt : the clean data generated through the R script
